## 💡 Why Vectorization?
Traditional CPUs work on one piece of data at a time (scalar).
Vector processors work on many at once 🏋️‍♂️ — Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD).

Benefits of vectorization:

- ⚡ Faster execution on repetitive, data-heavy loops
- 🔋 Lower power use by doing more work per instruction
- 💾 Better memory efficiency

```C++
// Scalar (Old Way)
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
}

// Vectorized (SIMD Way — all at once)
C[0..3] = A[0..3] + B[0..3]; // in one instruction!
```
